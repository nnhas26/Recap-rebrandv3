                        In this webinar session, Kevin Haldeman shared his knowledge for aspiring entrepreneurs and startup founders in recruiting
                         the best talent for their business. The following information comes from his best practices while working at Google.
                          Even though this information is aimed at aspiring entrepreneurs and startup founders, it will also be very useful for 
                          those of you who are looking for work to know how to be the best talent and be able to fit into the criteria sought by 
                          companies in general.

                        <b>The first point is to create a High Level of Collaboration</b>
                        <h5>
                        <br>
                            In order for all team members to be collaborative, it must create a sense of mutual trust by
                            not
                            only involving them in their daily routine work but also in new projects, where they can
                            give
                            ideas and take their respective parts. The point is, during a pandemic like this you have to
                            think about other things you can do from your home and create something new.
                        </h5>

                        <b>Good talent is a talent that has good general cognitive abilities.</b>
                        <h5>
                        <br>
                                Things that we think are not significant turn out to be used as indicators to decide whether or not 
                                we are included as good talent criteria for a company. This can be generally obtained from answers or
                                tests during the recruitment process. Kevin explained that it is very important for a recruiter to be able
                                to know the general cognitive ability of a candidate. These include problem-solving skills, learning agility,
                                and judgment calls.
                        </h5>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-sm-12">
                        <b>Problem Solving Skills</b>
                        <h5>
                        <br>Problem-solving skills are one of the important soft skills needed in employees. This ability will be very
                                 useful when we have to make decisions on difficult and unexpected situations or problems at work. During 
                                 an interview, case study questions such as how do you determine priorities and what happens if there is a problem, 
                                 these are not cliché questions. The recruiter will record each of our answers which later will be assessed.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                            Problem-solving skills can be trained from the problems that arise in our daily lives. Starting by enriching our insight
                                into a problem by researching, asking questions, or watching tutorials on YouTube. In addition, 
                                we can also begin to change our mindset in looking at a problem. It would be better, if we consider the problem as a 
                                challenge, like in games. The more we complete a level in the game, the more difficult it will be at the next level. 
                                We have to think harder to complete the next level. It is also applicable to work.
                        </h5>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-sm-12">
                        <b>Learning Agility</b>
                        <h5>
                            <br>Besides problem-solving skills, Kevin also recommends startup founders to see talent from their learning agility. 
                                Learning agility is the ability to learn and adapt, both in life and in previous organizations. 
                                Ideally, when companies recruit new employees, they are looking for people who have a strong willingness to learn,
                                high comprehension ability, and able to keep up with other’s work rhythm.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            For fresh graduates, we should carefully research the company that we apply for a job. It could be their product, 
                            the work culture seen in the media, product, or service that are recently released, etc. Moreover, 
                            learning agility can also be detected from our answers regarding our aspirations or achievements so far. For example, 
                            we can't design but we are excited to see artsy posts and desperately want to have design skills. Recruiters will see the 
                            extent of our willingness in learning things. In order to practice learning agility, we have to commit to what we want to master.

                        <b>Judgement call</b>
                        <h5>
                            <br>Kevin said that it is also important to assess prospective employees by their judgment call abilities. Judgement call is 
                            the ability to make decisions based on personal ideas or opinions. Generally, in an interview, questions will appear like 
                            "What do you think ...."
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Judgement call is crucial because generally from our opinions, the company will match it with the existing corporate 
                            culture or the knowledge that is applied to each position. As a consideration of the extent to which we match the 
                            prospective companies. Judgement call will also represent our view of things, our ability to take risks, and our ability 
                            to make decisions.

                            <br>The three points above are how to find the best talents for companies which are certainly useful for job seekers too.
